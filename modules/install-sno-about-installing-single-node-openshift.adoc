= About installing Single Node OpenShift

You can create a single node cluster with standard installation methods. Single Node OpenShift (SNO) is a specialized installation that requires the creation of a special ignition configuration ISO. The primary use case is for edge computing workloads, including intermittent connectivity, portable clouds, and 5G radio access networks (RAN) close to a base station. The major tradeoff with an installation on a single node is the lack of high availability.
